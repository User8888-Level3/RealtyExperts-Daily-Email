    "news": "Nvidia Earnings Beat:\n\nInvestors were calling Nvidia's (NVDA +1.44%) earnings report last night a \"make or break\" moment.\n\nWhat happened? The company beat Wall St. expectations for Q4 2025 earnings, as well as future outlook. The company expects $5B more in revenue in Q1 than analysts predicted — and that's assuming no revenue from China.\n\nThe stock's performance has been mostly flat for several months, but rose 3% in after-hours trading."

Workers who do not already have access to an employer-sponsored 401k — around 56M people.\n\nLower Rates, More Refinances:\n\nMortgage rates have now hit their lowest rate in years, spurring a wave of refinances.\n\nAn index that tracks refinancing activity spiked up more than 4%, and refinancing activity has trended higher throughout the year as rates fall.\n\nBut: There hasn't been a strong wave of buying activity, despite the lower rates."

    "commentary": "The Bay Area is seeing a \"tale of two markets\" with single-family homes selling quickly in under 20 days while the condo market has slowed significantly, with units sitting for an average of 51 to 55 days.\n\nLatest Real Estate News in the Bay Area:\n\n🏡 Diverging Values in the East Bay: Single-family home prices in Alameda County have seen a turnaround, rising 2.86% year-over-year to a median of $1,150,000. Conversely, the condominium market remains under pressure with a 6.36% decline in median prices and nearly double the time on market compared to detached homes.\n\n🏡 Silicon Valley Inventory Squeeze: Santa Clara County continues to face an acute supply shortage, with single-family inventory down 12% compared to last year. The market remains firmly in seller territory with less than one month of supply (0.9 MSI), though median prices saw a modest annual dip of 3.89% to approximately $1.73 million.\n\n🏡 Shifting Buyer Leverage: While single-family homes in prime areas like Fremont and Milpitas still move rapidly, buyers are gaining more negotiating power in the condo segment. Seasonal cooling has brought more balance to attached housing, where days on market and market absorption have increased significantly.\n\nLatest General News in the Bay Area:\n\n📰 Community Mourning in Milpitas: The local community is mourning a 29-year-old Milpitas motorcyclist who tragically succumbed to his injuries following a solo collision with a traffic island in Newark earlier this month.\n\n📰 Fremont Civic Updates: The Fremont Fire Department and Newark Police recently handled major traffic fatalities while local school boards and community centers prepare for upcoming March job fairs and student internship events.\n\n📰 Milpitas Dining Milestone: Local residents are bidding a final farewell to Koong's, a staple Chinese restaurant in Milpitas that officially closed its doors after more than 40 years of service to the community."

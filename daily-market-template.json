    "commentary": "Market Status (Feb 7): Strong Seller's Market\n• Inventory Update: Inventory has ticked up slightly to 56 active listings as of this morning, but demand remains high with a Market Action Index of 67 (out of 100).\n• Median List Price: Currently hovering around $1.65 million.\n• Affordable Housing Opportunity: The City of Fremont has a notable \"Below Market Price\" (BMP) opportunity open right now. A brand-new townhome on Fremont Blvd is available for ~$364k for eligible income-qualified applicants. The deadline to apply is coming up on February 20, 2026, making this a key action item this weekend for first-time buyers.\n• Today's Open Houses (Examples):\n  o New Construction: 43257 Newport Dr (5 bed, 4 bath) — Listed at ~$3.3M.\n  o Single Family: 34504 Willbridge Ter (3 bed, 3 bath) — Listed at ~$1.85M.\n  o Townhouse: 38860 Garibaldi Cmn — Listed just under $1M ($965k), expected to draw heavy interest due to the sub-$1M price point.\n\n📍 Fremont & Alameda County\n\nThe biggest real estate factor this weekend is logistics. With Super Bowl LX festivities dominating Santa Clara and overflow traffic affecting Milpitas and Fremont, real estate activity is experiencing a unique disruption:\n• Open House Logistics: While many open houses are proceeding as scheduled today, real estate agents are advising buyers to plan routes carefully to avoid traffic snarls around I-880 and Hwy 237.\n• Buyer Competition: Expect slightly thinner crowds at open houses today and tomorrow as casual lookers attend Super Bowl events (like the Tailgate at Great Mall). This offers a strategic window homes with less immediate competition."

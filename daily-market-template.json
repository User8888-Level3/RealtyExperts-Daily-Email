    "homebuilder": "Construction Confidence:\n\nHome builders are not feeling great these days.\n\nThat's because an index tracking their confidence has dropped again, to 36, the lowest since September 2025.\n• Anything under 50 is considered \"poor conditions\" for home builders.\n\nWhat's weighing it down? Tariffs increasing material costs, loss of labor pool due to immigration policy, and buyers just can't afford homes.\n\nBanks Want Back In The Game:\n\nBanks have been getting out of mortgage lending, down from 60% in 2008 to 35% today.\n• Why? Rules changed after the 2008 housing crisis, making it harder for banks to loan money.\n\nSo the Fed wants to change the rules again, to make it easier for banks to get back in the home loan game.",
    "commentary": "📍 Alameda County (Fremont Focus)\n\nFremont is currently outperforming its neighbors with stronger momentum than parts of Santa Clara County. While Silicon Valley (Santa Clara) is seeing a surprisingly slow start to the spring season with softening prices, Fremont (Alameda County) remains a competitive seller's market with rising demand and tight inventory.\n\nMarket Status - \"Strong Seller's Market\":\n\nAs of mid-February data, Fremont has an incredibly low 0.7 months of supply.\n• Competition: Homes are selling for roughly 101.7% of the asking price.\n• Speed: Average days on market is hovering around 45 days, but desirable single-family homes are moving much faster (often under 14 days).\n• Median Price: Trending between $1.38M and $1.69M, depending on the neighborhood.\n• Prices are Rising: Unlike its southern neighbor, Alameda County is seeing price growth. The median sale price is roughly $925,000, up 2.6% year-over-year.\n• Sales Volume is Down: Total sales have dropped about 8% compared to last year. This indicates a \"gridlock\" where buyers want to buy, but there simply aren't enough sellers listing their homes.\n• Buyer Behavior: Buyers are re-entering the market now (in February) rather than waiting for April/May, trying to beat the competition before interest rates potentially fluctuate again."

It beat Q4 2025 expectations, and its revenue was up 29%.\n\nDatadog sells monitoring and analytics to AI companies like Amazon (AMZN -0.87%) and OpenAI.\n\nFlashback: Datadog stock had fallen 16% during the \"SaaSpocalypse\", and is still slightly down YTD.\n\n(A)I Don't Need You:\n\nFinancial services stocks fell on Tuesday because an AI software that can pretty much do the same thing was launched.\n\nA Bloomberg analyst says AI could reduce the need for traditional, in-person financial services.\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW -7.42%), Raymond James (RJF -8.75%), and LPL (LPLA -8.31%) all dropped over 8% at one point on the news.\n\nBP Hits Pause:\n\nBritish oil giant BP (BP -5.75%) said it will take a break from stock buybacks."

Consumers pulled back their spending, which can be a warning sign for the overall economy.\n\nThe AI Paradox:\n\nAI has been promised to make life easier and eventually even replace some workers.\n\nBut a new study from Harvard shows that so far, the opposite is happening: AI is making work more intense.\n\nThat's because instead of reducing workload, employees are now just adding more tasks because AI allows them to do more."

    "commentary": "📊 California Statewide Update (Released Yesterday, Feb 10):\n\nIf you are keeping an eye on the macro trends, the California Association of Realtors (C.A.R.) released their Q4 2025 affordability report yesterday. It brought a sliver of good news: housing affordability in California saw a slight improvement compared to both last quarter and last year, driven by a dip in borrowing costs. However, it's still tight—a household still needs a minimum annual income of roughly $213,200 to qualify for a median-priced California home ($869,300).\n\n🏡 Alameda County: Spring Buyers Are Waking Up Early:\n\nAcross the board, the market is waking up ahead of the traditional spring rush.\n\n• Buyers Rushing Rates: Local real estate reports published earlier this week highlight that buyers who sat on the sidelines in late 2025 are cautiously re-entering the market to lock in current mortgage rates (currently hovering around 6.35%) before they potentially rise later in the year.\n\n• Pricing & Inventory: The median sale price in Alameda County is hovering around $950,000 to $968,000. Inventory remains tight—down about 8% year-over-year—meaning move-in-ready homes and condos in places like Oakland, Hayward, and Alameda are seeing a lot of foot traffic and quick sales.\n\n• Major AI Tech Win for Local Business: Fremont-headquartered semiconductor company Aehr Test Systems made major headlines today. They announced a massive strategic win, securing an initial production purchase order from a lead hyperscale customer. They will be providing their ultra-high-power \"Sonoma\" testing systems for next-generation AI processors, a great win for Fremont's local tech footprint."

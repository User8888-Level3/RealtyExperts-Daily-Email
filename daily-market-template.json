    "homebuilder": "A \"Soft\" Spring Start:\n\nThe early 2026 spring market in Silicon Valley is kicking off slower than expected. Recent data reveals that closed single-family home sales in Santa Clara County dropped 16% year-over-year in January, and the median price softened slightly (down about 3.3% to $1.74M). Months of inventory effectively doubled from December to January, sitting at 1.9 months. It's not a crash, but buyers are definitely pushing back against the \"automatic spring surge.\"\n\nAcross Alameda County, the median sale price is sitting right around $925,000 to $1M. The big story here is inventory: active listings have increased significantly compared to this time last year. This is giving buyers more room to breathe and negotiate. While the sale-to-list ratio remains strong (around 102% to 104%), homes that need work or are priced too ambitiously are sitting longer.\n\nFremont remains highly competitive, but the frenzy has leveled out a bit. The median home price is hovering around $1.2M to $1.25M. While homes are still selling quickly—averaging about 21 to 26 days on the market—Redfin's latest January/February data shows a slight year-over-year price dip of around 2.6%. The market is punishing sellers who overprice, but turnkey, well-priced homes are still seeing multiple offers and selling above asking.",
    "commentary": "🌉 The Broader Bay Area Picture:\n\nThe current vibe across the Bay Area real estate scene can be summed up as \"picky.\"\n• With mortgage rates still drifting around 6%, buyers are refusing to overpay for homes that aren't move-in ready.\n• We're seeing a shift where inventory is expanding slightly faster than sales are closing. It's still a seller's market by historical standards, but buyers currently have the most leverage they've had in a while to negotiate terms or ask for repairs."

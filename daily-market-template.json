    "homebuilder": "Another Housing Coldfront:\n\nSales of already owned homes fell 8% in January - the biggest single-month drop since February 2022.\n\nWhy the drop? Buyers are bailing. Mixed confidence about the economy, fewer homes on the market, means some Americans put their home dreams on hold.\n• Homes are sitting on the market for longer - 46 days, up from 41 in Jan 2025.\n\nUnless you're buying a $1 million+ home, as that was the only segment that saw a rise in prices last month.\n\nThe Commercial Crater:\n\nThe Super Bowl is all about commercials - but in real estate, not so much…\n\nSource: https://click.market.briefs.co/t/c/b44be4b08bab423ebb27952a7a810fbb-3b08b0d59f15450f8099440f0c0cad44/77\n\nCommercial real estate stocks fell yesterday as the AI market selloff grew larger.\n\nWhy the scare?

    "commentary": "🏡 Alameda County vs. Santa Clara County:\n\nBoth counties are seeing a slow but steady seasonal increase in inventory, which is good news if you are spending your weekend going to open houses.\n\n• Alameda County: This is where buyers are currently finding slightly more breathing room. The median sale price is sitting around $950,000, which is actually down a bit (about 7%) year-over-year. Homes are spending an average of 28 to 32 days on the market. Buyers who are willing to commute a little further are finding better value here.\n\n• Santa Clara County: The South Bay remains a premium market. The median sale price is holding steady at $1.5M, experiencing a very minor 1% dip compared to last year. Homes here sell faster than in Alameda County, averaging just 24 days on the market. The high-end luxury market and single-family homes in prime school districts remain intensely competitive.\n\n• Inventory is Waking Up: If you are heading out this weekend, you should notht uptick in \"For Sale\" signs. Sellers who held off during the winter holidays are starting to list, meaning buyers finally have a few more choices, easing the bidding war pressure just a fraction.\n\nBay Area real estate can be an emotional rollercoaster, so having a firm grasp on the data is your best defense.\n\nNo-Fee ADU Permits in Milpitas: For Milpitas homeowners, the city just announced that it is currently waiving permit fees for building or legalizing Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). The Office of Building Safety will cover these fees via the Community Investment Fund, which could save eligible homeowners an average of $5,000.\n\nMajor Drug Bust: Authorities announced the discovery of 300 pounds of processed marijuana in an illegal cultivation investigation in San Leandro, which resulted in a Wednesday arrest."

    "commentary": "AI Recession Warning:\n\nOver the weekend, a report from Citrini Research went viral. The firm lays out a scenario in which AI adoption will be successful, but lead to a recession in 2028. The report says unemployment could go above 10%, and the stock market could fall nearly 40%. But before we all freak out... Citrini says the doomsday scenario is just a \"thought experiment\" and not a prediction.\n\nTariff Updates:\n\nLast week the Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, saying they were illegal. But Trump had a back-up plan, and announced a new 10% universal tariff using a different law. Then, over the weekend, he increased that to a 15% universal tariff — which is the legal limit. The E.U. responded by pausing its talks for a trade deal with the U.S."

    "commentary": "The Bay Area remains a strong seller's market with extremely tight supply, particularly for single-family homes in Santa Clara and Alameda Counties, where inventory sits at approximately 0.9 to 1.1 months.\n\nLatest Real Estate News in the Bay Area:\n\n• Divergence in East Bay Property Types: While single-family home prices in Alameda County rose 2.86% year-over-year to a median of $1,150,000, the condominium market saw a 6.36% price decline. Single-family homes are moving quickly in about 19 days, whereas condos are sitting for an average of 51 days.\n\n• Silicon Valley Inventory Crisis: Santa Clara County's single-family home inventory is down 12% compared to last year. This scarcity has kept the region in a firm seller's market, even as the median single-family home price saw a modest year-over-year dip of 3.89% to $1,730,051.\n\n• Shifts in Homeowner Mobility: Economic analysts suggest that the \"lock-in\" effect of low pandemic-era mortgage rates is slowly fading as more homeowners now hold rates above 6%. However, sluggish hiring confidence may now be a larger constraint on household mobility than borrowing rates alone."

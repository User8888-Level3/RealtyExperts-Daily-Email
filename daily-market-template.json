    "homebuilder": "George Washington: The Operator\n\nAmerica's first president wasn't just a military leader - he was a businessman.\n\n• Washington ran his Mount Vernon property in Virginia like an enterprise. He managed crops, labor, exports and shifting demand.\n\nWhen tobacco stopped being profitable, he started growing wheat instead.\n\nHe experimented with crop rotation and invested in infrastructure like mills and fisheries.\n\nHe understood margins and risk.\n\nWashington didn't inherit a fortune and sit on it - he put the money to work.",
    "commentary": "📍 Fremont Focus (Alameda County)\n\nFremont is currently a fascinating micro-market. While there was a lot of buzz over the weekend about general Bay Area softening, Fremont is kicking off the 2026 spring season with serious momentum, particularly for single-family homes.\n\n• Sellers Still Hold the Cards: Fremont remains a tightly constrained seller's market. Current inventory sits at a razor-thin 0.7 to 1 month of supply. (For context, a balanced market is typically 4 to 6 months of supply).\n\n• Fast-Moving Inventory: If a home is presented well and priced right, it isn't sitting. Single-family homes are spending an average of just 27 to 45 days on the market.\n\n• Overbidding is Still the Norm: Buyers are still having to compete. Recent weekend data shows Fremont homes are selling for an average of 101.6% to 103.9% of their asking price.\n\n• Prices are Slightly Softer: The median single-family home price in Fremont is currently hovering around $1.34M to $1.4M. While obviously still a massive number, this is actually down slightly (around 4% to 13%, depending on the exact neighborhood and metric) compared to this time last year. It shows that while demand is high, buyers are hitting a firm affordability ceiling and aren't willing to overpay blindly.\n\nFUSD Staff Layoffs: A tough story making the rounds today is that the Fremont Unified School District (FUSD) is laying off over 40 staff members at the end of the school year due to funding shortages. The cuts primarily impact bilingual assistants, instructional paraeducators, and community liaisons, which is understandably causing frustration among local parents and the teachers' union.\n\nCity Council Budget & Doordash Robots: The City Council is holding a meeting tonight (Feb 17). On the agenda is a discussion about deploying Doordash delivery robots on city streets. Additionally, the city recently approved a budget rebalancing plan to cover new labor agreements. While no sworn police or fire positions are being cut, the Police Department is eliminating a handful of civilian administrative and detention roles.\n\nGreen Tech Hub Expanding: Fremont-based Enphase Energy made headlines in the financial and tech spaces this morning by launching new power control software. It's designed to make commercial solar installations much cheaper and easier by bypassing the need for costly physical utility upgrades."

    "news": "Stellantis Posts Historic Loss:\n\nJeep maker Stellantis reported its first annual loss in company history, posting a full-year 2025 net loss of €22.3 billion ($26.3 billion), compared to a profit of €5.5 billion in 2024. The loss was driven by EV write-downs across its brands including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler, and Peugeot.\n\nNvidia Beats But Falls:\n\nNvidia (NVDA -5.46%) beat Q4 earnings expectations — reporting adjusted EPS of $1.62 vs. estimates of $1.53 and revenue of $68.1 billion vs. estimates of $65.9 billion — but the stock fell anyway. Markets had priced in perfection, and investors used the beat as an opportunity to sell. Nvidia has now fallen more than 5% over two consecutive sessions."

    "commentary": "Low-Hire, Low-Fire Job Market:\n\nWeekly jobless claims came in at 212K, better than the expected 216K — a positive sign for labor market resilience. But economists caution this isn't necessarily good news. The market is stuck in \"low-hire, low-fire\" territory: employers aren't adding jobs, but they're not cutting them either. Businesses appear to be in a holding pattern as they wait for more economic clarity.\n\nGDP Miss + Sticky Inflation:\n\nFourth-quarter U.S. GDP grew just 1.4%, badly missing Wall Street estimates. At the same time, inflation firmed at 3% — well above the Fed's 2% target. The combination of slowing growth and sticky inflation raises the risk of stagflation, keeping the Fed in a difficult position heading into spring.\n\nNote: The 10-Year Treasury nominal yield fell below 4% to ~3.97% on Friday — its lowest in three months — as investors fled to safety amid stock market declines."

    "commentary": "🏗️ Alameda County News:\n\nThe \"stabilization\" trend is the main theme for Alameda County today.\n\n• Price Divergence: Single-family homes are holding steady with a median price of roughly $968,000, while the condo market is struggling, seeing year-over-year declines in the double digits in some areas.\n\n• Sales Activity: Interestingly, over the weekend and through yesterday (Feb 9), several homes in cities like Dublin and Oakland sold for 30% to 45% over asking, signaling that the \"bidding war\" culture isn't dead for move-in-ready properties.\n\n📍 Fremont Spotlight\n\nFremont continues to be one of the most resilient \"micro-markets\" in the East Bay.\n\n• Market Action Index: As of this week, Fremont holds a score of 67, categorizing it as a Strong Seller's Market. While this is a slight dip from last month's 69, it remains significantly higher than the national average.\n\n• Pricing: The median list price is presently hovering around $1,649,444.\n\n• Inventory: There is a slight uptick in choices for buyers, with 56 active listings this week. However, the median days on market is a crisp 18 days, meaning well-priced homes are still moving in under three weeks.\n\n🗝️ Key Takeaway for Today:\n\nIf you are looking in Fremont, the \"hot\" homes are still going pending in under 10 days. In Milpitas, the market is slightly more forgiving for buyers (34 days on average), but the lack of new listings means you have to act immediately when a property hits the MLS."

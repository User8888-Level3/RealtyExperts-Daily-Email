Competition from companies like Uber (UBER -3.39%), promotional costs, and even weather-related rides.\n\nBut between a $1B buyback and new laws making insurance cheaper in California, Lyft hopes to drop costs and lift earnings and revenue by year-end.\n\nKing Of The Hill:\n\nWhen Nike (NKE -1.09%) appointed Eliot Hill as its CEO, the brand was losing ground to competitors like Adidas and Hoka.\n\n• But Hill is showing that the world runs on Nike, as the brand races towards Europe and Asia after boosting sales in the U.S."

They are about 0.2% lower than conventional loans.",

While still competitive, the frenzy has calmed significantly compared to last year.\n• Prices & Sales:\n• Median Sale Price: $1.17M (Down 2.6% year-over-year).\n• List Price Trends: The median list price this week is hovering around $1.7M.\n• Competition: Homes are selling in approximately 21–26 days. While \"hot\" homes still sell in ~9 days, the average time on market has increased by 9 days compared to last year.\n• Recent Sales (This Week & Weekend):\n• Sold Feb 11: 4-bed on Wisteria Dr sold for $2.85M (6% over list).\n• Sold Feb 11: 3-bed on Eggers Cmn sold for $1.13M (8% over list).\n• Sold Feb 9: 2-bed condo on Rothbury Cmn sold for $639k (at list price).\n• New Opportunity: The City of Fremont has a deadline approaching on Friday, Feb 20, 2026, for its \"Below Market Price\" (BMP) home (a brand-new townhome on Fremont Blvd).\n\nDeveloping Story - Musician Killed by Deputies (San Leandro/Alameda County):\n\nThe biggest story in the East Bay today involves the identification of the man shot and killed by Alameda County Sheriff's deputies earlier this week.\n\n• Update Today: The victim has been identified as Anthony Anderson, a 40-year-old local Bay Area trumpeter.\n\nCorruption Plea (San Leandro):\n\nFormer San Leandro City Councilmember Bryan Azevedo pleaded guilty today/late yesterday to federal corruption charges. This is sending shockwaves through local East Bay politics, as he has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors, which could lead to further investigations in the county."

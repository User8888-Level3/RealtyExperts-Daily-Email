But then, news came that the Department of Justice is looking into builders for potential antitrust violations. The White House is considering looking into whether companies like Lennar and D.R. Horton (DHI -1.18%) have been unfairly holding back on building new homes.\n\nHigh-Tech Housing:\n\nThe founder of Uber (UBER -0.59%) is looking into making a new bet: apartments. But not just any old apartments: he wants to create new, high-tech apartment buildings aimed at young professionals. The buildings would feature smart-home tech and also communal areas for socialization - kinda like dorm buildings but for adults.",
    "commentary": "📍 Fremont & Alameda County\n\nAs of today, February 9, 2026, the local market is waking up from a slow winter. The big headline is a surge in inventory for Santa Clara County, while Alameda County remains tighter. For Fremont specifically, the news is driven by new construction opportunities and a stabilizing market where buyers finally have some leverage on pricing, unless the home is \"turnkey.\"\n\nData from transactions finalized just before and over the weekend reveals a mixed market in Fremont. Buyers are no longer automatically paying over asking price; condition is everything.\n• Over Asking: A 3-bed home on Merlin Ct (94539) closed Feb 4 for $3.4M (27% over list).\n• Under Asking: A 4-bed home on Ottawa Way (94539) sold for $2.06M (1% under list) after sitting for 85 days.\n• Takeaway: The \"frenzy\" is reserved only for perfect homes. If a home needs work, it is sitting, and you can negotiate.\n\nMarket Vital Signs:\n• Inventory: Active listings in Fremont have ticked up slightly.\n• Flood Risk: New insurance maps and data highlighted over the weekend show Fremont has a moderate fire risk (47% of properties) but remains lower risk for severe flooding.\n\n[IMAGE:https://harvinder.dscloud.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-superbowl.jpg]\n\nThe Super Bowl LX Effect:\n\nThe biggest news dominating the entire region today is the fallout from Super Bowl LX (60), which was played yesterday at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara (bordering Milpitas).\n• The Game: The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots (29-13).\n• Transit Success: VTA reports record-breaking ridership yesterday, transporting over 30,000 fans to the stadium, far exceeding expectations.\n• Violence in San Jose: The celebration was marred by violence. Five people were shot late Sunday night near San Pedro Square in downtown San Jose, just hours after the game ended. This is heavily impacting morning news in Santa Clara County."
